            <h2> PENS / PENCILS: </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pens are everyday essentials needed for school</li>
                <li>MUJI pends are one of the highest rated pens for note-taking.</li>
                <li> Our favourite pens are the MUJI Gel Pens in the shade Navy Blue. </li>
                <p>MUJI pens are known for the high-quality, superior design. Durable <br>and long-lasting. They are available in a variety of colors,<br> suitable for different lessons and writing tasks.  MUJI pens <br>are cheap, and can be want to be purchased more. MUJI <br>pens are a good choice for their quality, design and affordability.</p>

            <h2> NOTEBOOKS: </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Notebooks provide a way to reflect and look back on the notes students made.</li>
                <li>Writing down notes can also show a way of remembering the information better.</li>
                <p> Notebooks are essential for making notes, and <br>keeping track of the stuff we learn in school.<br> For other students, I recommend the <br>Hilroy 3 subject notebooks, as they have a lot of pages, <br>good quality, and they don't easily rip <br>out of their cover. </p>

            <h2> ERASERS/ WHITEOUT: </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>erasers/whiteout allows us to erase any kinds of mistake we make</li>
                <li>they can help us identify our mistakes, and make us confident as we teach ourselves</li>
                <li>A good eraser needs to clear all pencil on the paper, without leaving any marks.</li>
                <li>Whiteout needs to be smooth so that it can be written over with pen/pencil again.</li>
                <p> I recommend the Muji Eraser as when I use it to <br> erase, it doesn't leave any marks behind.<br> For whiteout, i reccomennd using the <br>BIC Correction tape as it is smoth and easy to write on.</p>

            <li>Highlighters need to be smooth and smudge-proof, in order to easily glide over pens.</li>
